# Mastermind Game

A React-based implementation of the classic Mastermind game.

## Overview

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player (the "code maker") sets a secret code, and the other player (the "code breaker") tries to guess the code. The code maker provides feedback on each guess, indicating how many colors are correct and in the right position.

This project is a React-based implementation of the Mastermind game, allowing users to play the game in their web browser.

## Features

- Generate a random secret code
- Allow users to make guesses and receive feedback
- Provide clear visual cues for the current guess and previous guesses
- Allow users to clear the current guess, either entirely or by individual pegs
- Display win/lose conditions and the secret code at the end of the game
- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
